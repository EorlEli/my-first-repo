So, O king, does the present life of man on earth seem to me, in comparison
with the time which is unknown to us, as though a sparrow flew swiftly 
through the hall, coming in by one door and going by the other, and you, the
while, sat at meat with your captains and liegemen, in wintry weather, with 
the fire burning in your midst and heating the room, the storm is raging out
of doors and driving snow before it. For the time for which he is within,
the bird os sheltered from the storm, but after th short while of calm he 
flies out again into the cold and seen no more. Thus, the life of man is 
visible for a moment, but we know not what comes before it or follows after 
it.
